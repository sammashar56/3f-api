To run the app and test the apis on postman or any similar software like curl type this command

```bash
$python run.py
```

You can choose to test the api's on postman using the remote url of the api hosted on heroku.

Open postman, and try this endpoints

|Endpoint|Function|
|--------|--------|
| `GET /api/v1/orders`|This endpoint gets all orders. 
| `GET /api/v1/orders/<id>`|This api gets a specific order.
| `POST /api/v1/orders`|This api creates a new order.
| `PUT /api/v1/orders/<id>`|This api updates an order status.
| `DELETE /api/v1/orders`|This deletes all orders 
| `DELETE /api/v1/orders/<id>`|This api deletes an order.


## GET all orders

When this is api is requested it returns all orders in json format as shown below:

```json
{
    "orders": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "username": "Lenson Gita",
            "products": {
                "name": "Pizza",
                "qty": 1,
                "price": 1000
            },
            "status": "Pending",
            "ordered_date": "2018-09-20 00:03:20.994632",
            "delivered_date": null
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "username": "Jeremy Fisher",
            "products": {
                "name": "French Fries",
                "qty": 1,
                "price": 1000
            },
            "status": "Pending",
            "ordered_date": "2018-09-20 00:03:21.873132",
            "delivered_date": null
        }
    ]
}
```

If there are no orders yet then a json similar to this will be shown:

```json
{
    "message": "No orders yet"
}
```

Meaning an order must be placed for it to appear here.

## POST place order

To use this api endpoint you need to send a json format file to get a response as shown:

```json
{
    "username":"Mikana Jusi",
    "products":{
        "name":"Hamburger",
        "qty":1,
        "price":500
    }
}
```

As you may have noticed the fields in this request json lacks fields to call it an order, the reason is the server only needs to be sent this specified fields in order the rest of the fields are autogenerated i.e. status is pending, ordered_date is the tim e of placing an order, id is autoincrement according to your orders length.

## GET specific order by id

By requesting an order of the id specified at the url, if there is an order the status returned will be `200 OK` for a success with the order object but if there is no order of that id then a `404 Not Found` error status will be sent 

## PUT specific order by id

For a `201 Created` status one needs to respond to the server with a json object shown below:

```json
{
    "status":"Delivered"
}
```

If no json response then the server will throw a `400 Bad Request` meaning that it lacks that field.

## DELETE specific order by id

For a successful delete the user or admin is thrown a `204 No Content` if in the uri they specified the order to be deleted i.e.

```handlebars
{{url}}/api/v1/orders/1
```

where 1 represents a specific id.

A `404 Not Found` error status is returned to the user or admin if the order of that id is not found.

## DELETE all orders

This api endpoint is used to clear the database of any orders in the users table or the admin table.

It has an easy step set the http verb to delete on postman then visit this uri:

```jinja
{{url}}/api/v1/orders
```

Either way a `204 No content` status is sent back to the user for a successful delete or a no delete at all but if there are no orders to delete, the status will be sent to you and a json object with a message:


```json
{
    "message":"No orders to delete"
}
```

If there are any orders to delete then this is the json reponse:

```json
{
    "message":"Orders successfully deleted"
}
```
